## Overview

This notebook presents a practical machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.

It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation and prediction
